# First Node & Git project

## Introduction

The purpose of this assignment is to get familiar with Node.js and dependency managment in Node.js. The task is to create a basic app with three routes:
- route with `/hello` displays a simple `Hello` mesage
- route with `/hello` that takes a `name` query parameter and any name value replies `Hello [name]` with a short sentence as message
- any other routes displays a 404 code with a `Not Found` message

## Run Instructions

To run the project, on the command prompt line, you have to go to the file directory by taping `cd [file directory]` and then start the project by taping `node index.js`. After that, open http://localhost:8080/ on your browser. You can try those different routes:
- http://localhost:8080/hello
- http://localhost:8080/hello?name=Vithusha 
- http://localhost:8080/
